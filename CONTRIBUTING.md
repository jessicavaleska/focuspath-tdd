# Contributing Guide â€“ FocusPath TDD

Thank you for contributing to **FocusPath TDD**! This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification to ensure clarity and consistency in commit messages.

## ðŸ’¬ Commit Message Format

```
<type>(scope): short and meaningful description
```

### Common types:

| Type       | Purpose                                              |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| feat       | New feature                                          |
| fix        | Bug fix                                              |
| test       | Adding or updating tests                             |
| refactor   | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| style      | Formatting changes (no code change)                 |
| docs       | Changes to documentation only                        |
| chore      | Maintenance tasks (e.g., configs, deps, builds)      |

### Examples

```
feat(task): add functionality to create new tasks
fix(task): fix bug when toggling task completion
test(task): add test for deleteTask method
refactor(task): simplify task filtering logic
docs(readme): update project description and instructions
```

## âœ… Tips

- Use the imperative mood in commit messages.
- Keep messages short and focused.
- Commits should represent atomic changes related to a single purpose.
